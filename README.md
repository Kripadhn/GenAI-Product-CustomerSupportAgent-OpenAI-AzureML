# GenAI-Product-CustomerSupportAgent-OpenAI-AzureML
<H2><B> Title </B></H2> Build a Customer Support Agent using OpenAI and AzureML

<H2><B> Description </B></H2> The project tackles the significant business problem of efficiently managing a large influx of customer support tickets, which often results in delayed responses, misprioritization, and inconsistent quality in customer service. By leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), this project aims to revolutionize the customer support process. LLMs can analyze and understand the content of support tickets, categorize them based on urgency and subject matter, and generate accurate and contextually appropriate responses.
In this project, we are developing a system that will use LLMs for tasks such as sentiment analysis, ticket categorization, and response generation, ensuring that critical issues are prioritized and handled promptly.

<H2><B> Approach </B></H2>
<b> ● Data Loading and Analysis </b><br>
○ Load the retail dataset containing customer support tickets and analyze.<br>
<b> ● LLM Integration </b><br>
○ Integrate a pre-trained LLM for generating embeddings and responses.<br>
<b> ● Vector Database Setup </b><br>
○ Set up a vector database (FAISS) to store embeddings for efficient retrieval.<br>
<b> ● Prompt Engineering </b><br>
○ Develop and refine prompting strategies to generate accurate and contextually relevant responses.<br>
<b> ● Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Implementation </b><br>
○ RAG Architecture<br>
○ Implement the RAG framework to combine retrieval-based and generation-based approaches.<br>
○ Use the vector database for retrieving relevant responses based on customer query embeddings.<br>
<b> ● Response Generation </b><br>
○ Implement the logic for generating responses using the retrieved information and the LLM.<br>
<b> ● Response Sampling </b><br>
○ Implement a sampling mechanism to generate multiple response candidates.<br>
○ Provide an interface for selecting the best response from the generated options.<br>
<b> ● Feedback Loop </b><br>
○ Creating a Feedback loop to improve the response based on prompt improvements.<br>
<b> ● Code Modularity and Streamlit UI </b><br>
○ Modularize the code to ensure easy integration and create a Streamlit UI<br>
<b> ● Azure Deployment </b><br>
○ Deploy the application on Azure ML, ensuring it is scalable and easy to maintain.<br>
